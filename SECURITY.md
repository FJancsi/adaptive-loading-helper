# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Latest major version.

## Reporting a Bug

Let’s keep things simple –

If you think you have identified a security related issue with the latest major version or repository, please report it to **fekete.janos2@gmail.com**. If you are not sure, don’t worry. Better safe than sorry – just send an email. Do not open issues related to any security concerns publicly. Please do not include anyone else on the disclosure email.

When reporting an issue, include as much information as possible, but no need to fill fancy forms or answer tedious questions. Just tell us what you found, how to reproduce it, and any concerns you have about it. We will respond as soon as possible and follow up with any missing information.

## Disclosure Policy

I try to report all identified security issues to the [npm Security Team](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories) as soon as an issue has been confirmed and works closely to issue responsible disclosures.

In general, public disclosure are made after the issue has been fully identified and a patch is ready to be released.
